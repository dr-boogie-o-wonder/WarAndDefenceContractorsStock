# WarAndDefenceContractorsStock

A python program which takes in given stock data from US's Top Five Largest Defence Contractors who recieve over 65% of their revenue from weapon's sales. It takes
this data and creates a direct index from these companies and charts their closing price for each day. The program also scans the subreddit r/news for any posts
which contain the title word "War" or "Wars." It then charts its findings in hopes of the user being able to find some visual correlation between the two charts.
